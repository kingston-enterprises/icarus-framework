Introduction
============

This framework offers a lightweight solution to kickstart php applications while also preparing them for faster and cleaner development.

The project consists primarily of a custom MVC core and a base application template.
The template already has all of the basic features constructed and tested, in addition to the core, which is fully built and tested.Â 
Together, they form a light foundation for any of our customer projects.

Prerequisites
=============
The whole idea behind the project is to have a framework with very few dependencies. 
So all you will need is a php installation and composer

The suggested installation method is via `composer`_:

.. code-block:: console

Base Application
----------------
- The base application is our own template for getting started building icarus applications. to get started 
just clone the repository or use it as a template from `here <https://github.com/kingston-enterprises/base-application>` and then run composer install

.. code-block:: console
   composer install

-then open the `env.example` file, enter your database credentials and then save it as `env.`
- Next just cd into your scripts directory and run the database migrations.

.. code-block:: console
   cd scripts
   php migrations.php


- Next move into your public folder and start your php server.

.. code-block:: console
