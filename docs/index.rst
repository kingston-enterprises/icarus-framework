Introduction
============

This framework provides a lightweight way to jumpstart php projects all while setting them up for easier and cleaner development.

Kingston enterprises is a small freelance software development company that specializes in providing our customers with high-quality software solutions.
From personal and business websites to web-based enterprise applications. 
Throughout our work with our clients we have found ourselves using and building upon the same code with essentially the same basic features, 
only with different presentation. As a general rule of software development we seek to avoid constantly repeatiing ourselves, 
to achieve this we wnated to build a our own framework that already has this commom codebase
 to help jumpstart client projects all while setting them up for easier and cleaner development.

The project is essentially a custom MVC core accompanied by a base application template.
 he template already has all the basi features built and tested alogn with with the core which has already been built and tested. 
Together they become a lightweight start to the life of any of our client projects.
