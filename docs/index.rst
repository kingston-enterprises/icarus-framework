Introduction
============

This framework offers a lightweight solution to kickstart php applications while also preparing them for faster and cleaner development.

The project consists primarily of a custom MVC core and a base application template.
The template already has all of the basic features constructed and tested, in addition to the core, which is fully built and tested.Â 
Together, they form a light foundation for any of our customer projects.
